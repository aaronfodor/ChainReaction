A reactive, thought-provoking strategy game for everyone.

ðŸ”´ðŸŸ¢ðŸ”µ

Chain Reaction is a strategy game where human and AI players can play against each other on different playgrounds. Each player has an allocated color, red (first player), green (second player), and so on. The objective is to take control of the board by eliminating your opponents' particles. Players take it in turns to place their atoms in a cell.

Once a cell has reached critical mass, the particles explode towards the surrounding cells adding an extra atom and claiming the cell for the player. The explosions might result in the overloading of an adjacent cell, and the chain reaction of the outbreaks continues until the system is stable.

When a red cell explodes, and green cells are around, the green cells are converted to red, and the other rules of explosions still follow. The same law is applicable for different colors.

A player may only place their atoms in a blank cell or a cell that contains atoms of their color. As soon as a player loses all their particles, they are out of the game.
